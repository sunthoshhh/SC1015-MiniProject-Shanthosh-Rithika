# Prediction model for the fashion industry

Our mini-project aims to predict the most liked style based on the different attributes of customers. This will be a useful tool for fashion companies to better understand what their target market wants and hence help them design more succesful products.





## Our Approach
We aim to predict the 'style attribte' variable using other underlying variable data such 'age','category',etc.

We will use the following machine learning models in our project:
1. Random Forest Tree
2. Gradient Booster Machine
3. Support Vector Machine

## Content
1. Dataset-10000_sales_data.xlsx
2. Exploratory Data Analaysis-EDA for new dataset.ipynb
3. Random Forest Tree-Random Forest Tree Modelling.ipynb
4. Gradient Booster Machine-gradient booster modelling.ipynb
5. Support Vector Machine-support vector machine.ipynb
6. Presentation Slides-Presentation slides.pdf


## Conclusion
1. Prediction accuracy for Random Forest was around 9%
2. Prediction accuracy for Gradient Booster Machine was around 10%
3. Predcition accuracy for Support Vector Machines was around 13%
4. We were unable to make an accurate model and this could likely due to the complex and subjective nature of people's fashion choices
5. It also could be due to inadequate feature represntation and inherent model limitations
6. The use of deep learning algorithms or advanced feature engineering could help boost the accuracy of prediction.
